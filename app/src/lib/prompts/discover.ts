${context}

Search the web and find the best freely available resources for this. Return ONLY a JSON array, no other text, no markdown backticks. Each item should have exactly these fields:
- url: the full URL
- title: the page/video title
- resource_type: one of "video", "text", "textbook", "problem_set", "reference_tool", "practice_exam", "other"
- source_domain: just the domain name (e.g. "jmap.org")
- ai_note: one sentence explaining why this resource is useful here specifically
- license_status: "cc_open" if Creative Commons or openly licensed, otherwise "link_only"

Rules:
- Find 3-5 learning resources (explanations, videos, readings) AND 2-4 practice problem sources
- ${domainGuidance}
- Only include resources that actually exist and are freely accessible
- Do not include resources that require login or payment
- Be specific: link to a specific page/video for this topic, not a homepage
- Match the difficulty level of the course — don't include beginner resources for advanced courses

Return only the JSON array.`;

Rules:
- Find 8-12 resources total that collectively cover all the concepts
- Each resource should list which understanding codes it covers in understanding_codes
- If a resource covers the whole topic generally, list all codes
- Only freely accessible resources, no login or payment required
- Match difficulty to the course level — advanced courses need advanced resources
- Return only the JSON object`;
